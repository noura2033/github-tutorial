## Git vs. GitHub
The difference between Git and GitHub is that Git is a version control of the code which takes   
vitrul snapshots. This means that when you edit a chunk of code, you   
  git commit it to save and push it to send to GitHub. This doesn't require GitHub though. Now GitHub on the other  
  hand requires Git. GitHub store code in the cloud which means you can perceptibly track your changes.

## Initial Setup
Initial Setup is the the quick, one-time setup you do when first starting your github account. Starting your github by   
doing 'git config (user.name & user.email)' is the initial setup. This tells Git the username and email associated with  
your Git commits. Next step is to connect with SSH whenever making a repository. To usee SSH , you need to get the SSH  
keys from GitHub. This is to push or pull from GitHub.
